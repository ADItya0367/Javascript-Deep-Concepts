Hi Everyone , 
so let's Start Javascript in very simple and fast Method . 

CONCEPT ------------------------------------

DEFINITION - Javascript is light weight , object. oriented , multi paradigm scripting lnaguage but sometimes also referred as 
             programming lnaguage . Javascript is introduced by Brenden Eich in 1995 to add dynamic interactivity to Browsers
             specially Netscape navigator . Make sure Javascript is not a compiled language  it is a translated language . 
             Couch Db and Mongo Db Works well with Javascript . 

             THINGS TO NOTICE 
                        -High Level ~ Js is High level language it means that it is human readable and we don not have to worry about process
                        or memory management.

                        - Multi Paradigm ~ Means we can use different styles of programming Declerative or imperative 

                        - Scripting Language ~ Are those language in which the source code is first compiled then it is converted into an Executable 
                        file by Compiler 


Features of Javascript ~
                        - Almost all web browsers supports Javascript as it provides built in execution environments 
                        - Light Weight 
                        - Structured Programming Lnaguage as it follows the structure of C language 
                        - Object oriented
                        - High Level 
                        - Multi Paradigm 

History of Javascript 
                        In 1994 there was a browser named as Mosaic was founded . In 1995 Mark Anderssen founded the 
                        new browser named as Netscape Navigator . He thought that it should be more dynmic in Nature For 
                        this purpose he hired Brenden Eich , So all done in 1995 . The first javascript code is called as Mocha 
                        and earlier it was named as Livescript . 

                        ** Javascript mainly Decides the behaviour of Web page , making it more dynamic 

COMING TO MAIN INTRODUCTION 

                CONCEPT-001-HOW JAVASCRIPT CAN CHANGE HTML CONTENT
                - it is mainily done with the help of  document.getElementById("Id here").innerHTML="New content"
                See an example in index.html file                                                 
   

                1--   /* here taking an div with id =change  */ 

                2--    /* here this function says that search in whoole document and get the element by id ....so we got change as id here 
             now its saying innerHTML so earlier the content was "This content will bne changed "  , and at last js changes that message  */

                3--    // script tag is always written before the body end and before the head end .

            PRACTICE EXAMPLES -----

            ~ document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';

            ~ document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";
              -- changing the font size of text
            ~ document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";
             --earlier the content is shown by display :block now it will be hidden by clicking on the button 


            ~ document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";
             -- here earlier the content will be hidden as you click on the button the content will be shown
