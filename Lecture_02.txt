CONCEPT--02

WHERE WE SOULD INCLUDE JAVASCRIPT FILE ??
 
 1- In the head tag before closing head tag
 2- in the body tag before the closing body tag
 3 we can also use external javascript file --- and you have to link script file in HTMLand we can do it in three ways 
     ~ directlyy using an url 
     ~ specifying the path 
     ~ just writing the file name 

     Method is same as <script src ="..."></script>

     ** if you are using the external javascript then no need to include the  script tags there !

 External Javascript iS Preferred mainly because of various reasons 
 -you can reuse the code many times 
 -Reduces the page loading times
 - Developers can work on html and js files paralelly 

DISADVANTAGE OF EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT 

  --- with the file link stealer can download the source code
  --- is there are two js files then error in one can cause problem in other 
  --- Browser needs to  make an additional http request to browser
